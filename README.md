A software to make it easier to make modded events for the game Touhou Puppet Dance Performance, only works with SoD.

Known bugs :
* Windows AV will probably mess a lot with this software, i'm working on a solution.
* In the List Events window, if you try to use it without putting a Working Directory Folder Path, the window will crash. This will be fixed in the next version.
